"""Persistent, *typed* cross-session memory using Dakera MCP.

Most "memory" demos treat `store` as "save everything the agent said" — a
transcript dump that gets noisy and useless within a few runs. This example
instead models memory as a **project-continuity layer** with an explicit
contract, following the three-tier model discussed in issue #12:

    working context  -> in-process mcp-agent state (ephemeral, not stored)
    session trace    -> what happened this run   (Dakera session, auditable)
    project memory   -> durable, *promoted* facts (Dakera long-term, typed)

The teaching point: only **promoted** records enter project memory, and each
one carries a type and scope so it can be retrieved deliberately later:

    MEMORY CONTRACT (encoded as Dakera tags on each stored record)
      type:<decision|convention|failed_path|bug_fix|open_question>
      project:<scope>          e.g. project:multi-agent-frameworks
      status:<accepted|candidate|superseded>

This unlocks the two capabilities from #12 that a plain store/recall loop
misses, and which this example demonstrates end to end:

  * scope-filtered retrieval — `dakera_batch_recall` filtered by the scope and
    status tags, so a new session pulls back *only* accepted project facts
    instead of a semantic soup of everything ever stored.
  * entity / knowledge-graph memory — `dakera_extract_entities` +
    `dakera_knowledge_graph` turn stored prose into a queryable entity graph.

MEMORY_CONTRACT = f"""\
You have persistent project memory via Dakera. Treat it as a continuity layer,
NOT a transcript. Follow this contract exactly:

1. At the start, call dakera_session_start, then dakera_batch_recall with
   tags ["{PROJECT_SCOPE}", "status:accepted"] to load what is already known.
   Do not re-research anything already recorded.
2. Only PROMOTE durable facts to memory with dakera_store. A fact is promotable
   if it is a decision, a convention, a failed path worth avoiding, a bug fix,
   or an open question — never a greeting, a restatement, or chit-chat.
3. Every dakera_store call MUST include tags:
     - "{PROJECT_SCOPE}"
     - one of "type:decision" | "type:convention" | "type:failed_path"
              | "type:bug_fix" | "type:open_question"
     - "status:accepted" for facts you are confident in (else "status:candidate")
   Use importance 0.8-0.9 for accepted facts so they survive decay.
4. Keep each record self-contained and one idea per record.
5. Call dakera_session_end with a short summary when finished.
